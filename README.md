# 🤖 Vision-Based Gesture-Controlled Robot using Deep Learning

An end-to-end robotic control system built from scratch — integrating computer vision, deep learning, and motor control for real-time gesture-driven navigation.

----
### 🧠 Overview

This project implements a gesture-controlled mobile robot using computer vision (OpenCV + MediaPipe) and deep neural gesture recognition models (TensorFlow/Keras).
The robot interprets human hand gestures in real time to perform navigation tasks like move forward, reverse, turn left/right, and stop, leveraging a Raspberry Pi for onboard computation and motor control via an H-Bridge driver.
